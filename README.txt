Directions: After launching the program the user will have to sign in. After sign in, the user will hit a home page.
            Within that home page, the user has the ability to add, modify and delete appointments by using the appropriate buttons
            in the view. If the user would like to adjust the view of the appointments, they will have to use the radio
            buttons along the top of the home view to filter by all, month, week, day and contact Name. The user also has the ability
            to go to the customer view and generate a monthly total by type.
            The monthly report view will have the user fill out the month they would like to see the report for as well.
            After selecting the type, it will display the total number of appointment filtered by those parameters.
            The customer view has the ability to add, modify and delete customer information as well as view it. There
            is a way to get back to the home view on this screen as well.
Additional report: I choose to make a daily report. This will filter out any appointments from the current date
                   time through the end of day that day.
